## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to create an HTTP request in order to take all data from Teleport API.

To accomplish this mission, I choose to use Axios.js and display the scores in a chart built with Chart.js.

## My process

### ðŸ›  Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Axios
- Chart.js

### What I learned

Process was really tough, but now I can strongly affirm that work with APIs is super exciting!

Also, this is the first time I work with a bundle such as Webpack, and I've understood how it can be extremely important in a project (especially when used in one much larger than this!).
